I am post graduate in art with several years of experience in museums and exhibitions. I can work effectively as part of a team. I am punctual, friendly and polite. I have good organisation and communication skills, that I have been gathered during university and my previous jobs. I am creative, reliable and responsible. I am motivated and committed to what I do and always willing to learn new things.

## Skills

#### fast learning

Before start Makers, I taught myself javascript and jQuery and made some projects(see [Other projects](https://github.com/GiadaSimonetti/OtherProjects)).
In the last two weeks of the course, we chose to do a new language for the backend (Elixir) with a new framework (Phoenix) and use a new library (React) for the frontend. As a group we faced many challenges but we used them as learning opportunities, to push and develop us.

Wide experience pair programming, not only with my peers but also with my mentees in more junior cohorts.

#### jkjjhjhjjjjj

I have a natural approach to facilitate other people’s learning, as I have done during my previous job at Primark. As a retail assistant, I was sent to Milan to support during the opening of the first store in Italy. My task was to train the new local personnel, and thanks to my support and coaching, they all passed the probation period and were ready for the role.
