## Giada Simonetti

I am post graduate in art with several years of experience in museums and exhibitions. I can work effectively as part of a team. I am punctual, friendly and polite. I have good organisation and communication skills, that I have been gathered during university and my previous jobs. I am creative, reliable and responsible. I am motivated and committed to what I do and always willing to learn new things.
